CompendiumNG, is a powerful application that lets you create extensive maps using nodes and link structure. Common usages of Compendium include: dialog mapping and mind mapping but its uses are almost limitless. Compendium was originally developed as a project by the OpenUniversity. In 2009 it was released as open source under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL) and in 2012 the Compendium community established CompendiumNG as an effort to maintain and further develop this great software.
