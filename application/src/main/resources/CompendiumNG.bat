rem FIXME: HOME/{.AppName} (Unix-like) and APPDATA\{DeveloperName\AppName} (Microsoft Windows) - for storing application settings. Many open source programs incorrectly use USERPROFILE for application settings in Windows - USERPROFILE should only be used in dialogs that allow user to choose between paths like Documents/Pictures/Downloads/Music, for programmatic purposes APPDATA (roaming), LOCALAPPDATA or PROGRAMDATA (shared between users) is used.
rem ... this is also our case (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable)
